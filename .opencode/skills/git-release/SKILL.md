# Git Release

Create a tagged GitHub release after the PO accepts the feature (Step 5).

## Version Format

`v{major}.{minor}.{YYYYMMDD}`

- **Major**: breaking changes (API changes, removed features)
- **Minor**: new features; also incremented if two releases happen on the same day
- **Date**: today in YYYYMMDD format

Examples:
```
v1.2.20260302  →  v1.3.20260415   (new feature, new day)
v1.2.20260302  →  v2.0.20260415   (breaking change)
v1.2.20260415  →  v1.3.20260415   (same-day second release)
```

## Release Naming

Each release gets a unique name: **`{adjective}-{bee-genus}`**

The adjective reflects what this release does or its character. The bee genus is chosen from the curated pool below, matched thematically to the release (e.g. a release about test orchestration might use *Bombus* — the highly-organized bumblebee; a release about precise detection might use *Osmia* — the meticulous mason bee).

**Constraints:**
1. **Thematic fit**: adjective and genus should together evoke the release character
2. **No repetition**: neither the adjective nor the genus may appear in any previous release name

Check previous names to avoid repetition:
```bash
gh release list --limit 100
```

### Curated Bee Genus Pool

Choose from this pool for intentional, memorable names. Each genus has a character note to guide thematic matching.

| Genus | Common name | Character / theme |
|---|---|---|
| *Apis* | Honey bee | Collaboration, industry, the gold standard |
| *Bombus* | Bumblebee | Robustness, persistence, surprising capability |
| *Osmia* | Mason bee | Precision, craftsmanship, careful construction |
| *Megachile* | Leafcutter bee | Clever tooling, cutting to shape |
| *Xylocopa* | Carpenter bee | Structural work, building into solid foundations |
| *Halictus* | Sweat bee | Small but essential, invisible infrastructure |
| *Lasioglossum* | Small sweat bee | Ubiquity, the most common; baseline correctness |
| *Nomada* | Nomad bee | Migration, discovery, exploratory behavior |
| *Andrena* | Mining bee | Digging deep, uncovering hidden things |
| *Colletes* | Plasterer bee | Sealing, finishing, waterproofing |
| *Hylaeus* | Masked bee | Hidden internals, minimal exterior |
| *Eulaema* | Orchid bee | Exotic, specialized, high-value collection |
| *Eufriesea* | Orchid bee | Rare, distinctive, one-of-a-kind |

| *Melitta* | Melitta bee | Sweetness, reward, delight |
| *Anthidium* | Wool-carder bee | Gathering, tidying, organization |
| *Coelioxys* | Sharp-tailed bee | Edge cases, pointed precision |
| *Stelis* | Cleptoparasitic bee | Detection, catching what doesn't belong |

| *Anthophora* | Digger bee | Fast, energetic execution |
| *Habropoda* | Digger bee | Buzz-pollination; resonance, vibration |
| *Amegilla* | Blue-banded bee | Vibrant, high-frequency operation |
| *Xylocopinae* | Carpenter bee subfamily | Load-bearing architecture |
| *Euglossa* | Orchid bee | Precision collection, perfume of quality |
| *Eulaema* | Orchid bee | Valuable, coveted output |
| *Trigona* | Stingless bee | Safe, no sharp edges, user-friendly |
| *Tetragonula* | Stingless bee | Compact, structured, geometric |
| *Meliponula* | Stingless bee | African precision; warm-climate reliability |
| *Frieseomelitta* | Stingless bee | Abundant output, productivity |
| *Scaptotrigona* | Stingless bee | Aggressive defense of quality |

| *Ctenocolletes* | Stenotritid bee | Ancient, foundational, rarely changed |
| *Stenotritus* | Stenotritid bee | Narrow, focused, specialized interface |

If the release theme doesn't match any entry above, choose any other real bee genus and add it to this list with a character note.

## Release Process

### 1. Analyze changes since last release

```bash
last_tag=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
git log ${last_tag}..HEAD --oneline
```

### 2. Calculate new version

```bash
current_date=$(date +%Y%m%d)
# Determine major.minor based on change type, then:
# new_version="v{major}.{minor}.${current_date}"
```

### 3. Choose release name

1. Read the commits and accepted features since the last release
2. Identify the theme (what did this release fundamentally accomplish?)
3. Choose an adjective that captures the theme
4. Choose a bee genus from the pool above that matches the theme
5. Verify neither the adjective nor the genus appear in previous release names:
   ```bash
   gh release list --limit 100
   ```

### 4. Update version in pyproject.toml

```bash
# Update the version field in pyproject.toml
# e.g.: version = "0.2.20260418"
```

No `__version__` in `__init__.py` — version is read at runtime via `importlib.metadata`.

### 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add at the top of the changelog (below the `# Changelog` heading):

```markdown
## [v{version}] — {Adjective Genus} — {YYYY-MM-DD}

### Added
- feat({feature-name}): description of what was added

### Fixed
- fix({feature-name}): description of what was fixed

### Changed
- refactor/chore: description of structural changes
```

Reference feature names (from `feat(<feature-name>): ...` commits), not PR numbers — this project uses direct commits rather than PRs.

### 6. Update living docs

Run the `living-docs` skill to reflect the newly accepted feature in C4 diagrams and the glossary. This step runs inline — do not commit separately.

Load and execute the full `living-docs` skill now:
- Update `docs/c4/context.md` (C4 Level 1)
- Update `docs/c4/container.md` (C4 Level 2, if multi-container)
- Update `docs/glossary.md` (living glossary)

The `living-docs` commit step is **skipped** here — all changed files are staged together with the version bump in step 7.

### 7. Regenerate lockfile and commit version bump

After updating `pyproject.toml`, regenerate the lockfile — CI runs `uv sync --locked` and will fail if it is stale:

```bash
uv lock
git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md uv.lock docs/c4/context.md docs/c4/container.md docs/glossary.md
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to v{version} — {Adjective Genus}"
```

### 8. Open a PR and merge it

Push to a release branch and open a PR against `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b release/v{version}
git push -u origin release/v{version}
gh pr create \
  --title "chore(release): v{version} — {Adjective Genus}" \
  --body "Version bump to v{version}. Merging this PR will automatically create the tag and trigger PyPI publish."
```

Once the PR is merged to `main`, the `tag-release` CI workflow fires automatically:
- Reads `version` from `pyproject.toml`
- Creates tag `v{version}` at the merge commit
- The `pypi-publish` workflow triggers on the new tag and publishes to PyPI
- The `publish-docs` CI job triggers on the push to `main` and deploys gh-pages

**Do not create the tag manually.** Let CI handle it.

### 9. Create GitHub release

After the tag is created by CI (check Actions to confirm), create the GitHub release pointed at the new tag:

```bash
gh release create "v{version}" \
  --title "v{version} — {Adjective Genus}" \
  --notes "# v{version} — {Adjective Genus}

> *\"{one-line tagline matching the release theme}\"*

## Changelog

### Added
- feat({feature-name}): description

### Fixed
- fix({feature-name}): description

### Changed
- refactor/chore: description

## Summary

2-3 sentences describing what this release accomplishes and why the genus name fits.

---
**SHA**: \`$(git rev-parse --short v{version})\`"
```

### 10. If the tag was created before the version bump landed on main

This can happen if CI is triggered by something other than the merge. Reassign the tag:

```bash
# Delete the old tag locally and on remote
git tag -d "v{version}"
git push origin ":refs/tags/v{version}"

# Recreate the tag on the correct commit
git tag "v{version}" {correct-sha}
git push origin "v{version}"
```

The release notes and title do not need to change — only the target commit moves.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] `living-docs` skill run — C4 diagrams and glossary reflect the new feature
- [ ] PR merged to `main` before creating GitHub release
- [ ] Tag created automatically by `tag-release` CI workflow (verify in Actions)
